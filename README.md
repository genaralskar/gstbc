genaralskar Turn Based Combat, or gstbc, is a turn based combat system I am developing for Unity. The plan is to make it simple and modular to allow easy integration with existing projects, as well as customizable allowing full control over the flow of combat.

Planned Featuers:
- Turn based combat with multiple allies and enemies
- Basic stat/gear system that affects damage calculation
- Single and Multitarget for attacks and items
- Each attack as a minigame the player must play to add or avoid damage, like the Mario and Luigi RPG series
- Items that can affect player health and stats

Stretch Goals:
- Equiped items provide different attacks
-
